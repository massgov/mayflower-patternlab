## Mayflower Artifacts
Some Mass Digital Services projects (i.e. [massgov/mass](https://github.com/massgov/mass)) use twig templates for markup in addition to the static css, js, + icon assets from Mayflower.  To establish that dependency, those projects point their dependency manager (i.e. [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)) to the [Mayflower Artifacts](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower-artifacts) repository which consists of these assets.  Learn more about Mayflower Artifacts in the [massgov/mass docs](https://github.com/massgov/mass/blob/master/docs/Mayflower.md#mayflower-artifacts).

## Built With

* [Pattern Lab 2 (PHP)](http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html) - The pattern framework / static site generator
* [Twig](https://twig.sensiolabs.org/) - The templating language
