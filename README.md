# Working with PatternLab
* All work is done in the source folder.
* Mark-up is in the source/_patterns directory.
* Front end assets can be found in the source/assets directory
* Gulp will handle the conversion of files from source to public
* Pattern Lab specific files are in the /public/styleguide directory (the styleguide.html file is automatically generated when twig templates are updated)

# Release Deployment
Tagged releases are automatically (via CircleCI) deployed to the [Mayflower Artifacts](https://github.com/palantirnet/mayflower-artifacts) repo for consumption by the Palantir team. Tags should follow [semantic versioning](https://github.com/sindresorhus/semver-regex) conventions.
