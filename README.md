# Mayflower [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/massgov%2Fmayflower.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/massgov%2Fmayflower)
Mayflower is the enterprise design system for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

## Getting Started

### Setting up your environment

In order to run Mayflower locally, you need to have some things installed and set up on your machine.  Follow the steps in [setting up your machine](docs/machine-setup.md).

#### Demo Install
- Follow the steps in [Demo Install](docs/demo-install.md) to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for *demo* and *testing* purposes. 

## Contribute

Please follow the steps in [Contributing docs](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to set up your fork and repo for *development* and *contribution* purposes.

## Deployment

### Developer Deployment

Please see [Deployment docs](docs/developer-deploy.md) for steps on deploying development work to a fork of Mayflower's Github Pages.
 
### Production Deployment

Mayflower release managers with the necessary repo permissions can see [Release docs](docs/release.md) for steps on deploying code to production (i.e. do a release).

## Generating assets

This project comes with gulp tasks to build Mayflower's static assets (html, css, js, + images) without serving them locally.  See the [gulp-readme](styleguide/tools/gulp/gulp-readme.md) for more information.

### Mayflower Artifacts
Some Mass Digital Services projects (i.e. [massgov/mass](https://github.com/massgov/mass)) use twig templates in addition to the static assets (html, css, js, image) from Mayflower.  To establish that dependency, those projects point their dependency manager (i.e. [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)) to the [Mayflower Artifacts](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower-artifacts) repository, which is a collection of Mayflower build artifacts with both twig and static assets.  Learn more about Mayflower Artifacts in the [massgov/openmass docs](https://github.com/massgov/openmass/blob/master/docs/Mayflower.md#mayflower-artifacts).
