# Demo Install

Follow these steps to get up and running to *demo* or *test* Mayflower.  Developers should see our [Contribute docs](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for directions on how to set up your repo for development and contribution purposes.

1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:massgov/mayflower.git`
1. Move into the styleguide directory `cd mayflower/styleguide`
1. Generate pattern lab default files `php core/console --generate`
1. Install npm dependencies `npm install`
1. Run `gulp`
1. Browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (or port shown in gulp output if you've configured it differently)
1. Take a look through Mayflower!  
    - You can use the menu to look at whole page layouts (pages), templates, components (organisms and molecules), child elements (molecules and atoms), and some nuts and bolts (base).
    - You can emulate different device sizes by using the size buttons at the top right of the menu bar (S M L FULL RANDOM DISCO).  
    - You can learn about patterns by clicking the top right COG icon, then selecting "Show Pattern Info" from the drop down.
1. When you're done looking, type `CTRL` + `C`  from your active terminal session to kill the `gulp` task.  You can always run `gulp` again from the `mayflower/styleguide` directory to get it back up and running.
