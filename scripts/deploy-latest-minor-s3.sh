# Deploying a latest minor version of Mayflower to Amazon S3:
#   mayflower.digital.mass.gov/<current-major-#>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note: this script updates the latest minor asset URLs which Mayflower consumers may use in their implementations.  Make sure you are not deploying any breaking changes!  See: https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/blob/dev/docs/versioning.md for help determining
#
# Run from the repo root, must have a clean working directory.
#
# Usage:
# ./scripts/deploy-latest-minor-s3.sh [-b (git-branch-or-tag)]
#   -b Build source: the git branch or tag from which to build (required)
#
# Description:
# 1. Validate the passed arguments: build source
# 2. Attempt to checkout passed build source
# 3. Get to mayflower/styleguide directory
# 4. Write config to support hosting from subdirectory, if necessary
# 5. Build pattern lab static assets
# 6. Copy static assets (build output: styleguide/public/) into a new temp directory
# 7. Execute gulp command to deploy to s3
# 8. Remove the temp directory
# 9. Check out the previous branch

# Default variables
buildSrc=false

# Get passed arguments
