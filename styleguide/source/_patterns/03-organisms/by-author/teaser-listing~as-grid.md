### Description
This is a variant of the [Teaser Listing](./?p=organisms-teaser-listing) pattern showing a list of General Teasers followed by a secondary grid of General Teasers.

### How to generate
* Set the `stacked` variable to false for displaying primary items side-by-side. Default is stacked.
* Set the `contained` variable to true for a grid display of secondary items. Defaults to a three column grid.
* Set the `gridTwoColumns` variable to true for an alternative two column layout for large screens. (Both display the same at smaller screen widths)
