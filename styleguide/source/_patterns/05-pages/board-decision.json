The individual appeared to be a methodical professional who demonstrated no bias or other hidden agenda against the Respondent or any other motive to be less than truthful. The Respondent did not contest the fact, but rather asked for a reprieve, promising to comply in the future. Unfortunately, this promise is too little too late. The Respondent had already received a letter of warning in March 2008 which went unheeded. The request for leniency cannot halt the disqualification process. Neither DPH nor DALA have any discretion but to uphold the controlling regulations in this case."
