## Future iterations
Once we've added contacts, locations to the Org Page then we can add address and contact point information.

Once we've got a better idea of how to represent topics, subtopics, services and have created content types for these as well as how-tos and guides, then we can add offer catalogs to represent those.

Once we've determined if / how to show a relationship between organizations then we can add information about that here as well.
