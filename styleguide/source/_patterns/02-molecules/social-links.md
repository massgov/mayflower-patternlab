---
Description: displays a list of sitewide social links

### Notes:
- The links are currently hardcoded and do not have real urls.
- Since the only visual content for the link is an icon, the pattern provides visually hidden contextual (action oriented ) link text for assistive technology

### Required Variables:
~~~
  socialLinks: {
    items: [{
      href:
