## 5.8.0

### Thanks!

We want to give a quick shout out and thanks to all of our friends who have helped to get Mayflower to where it is today through there contributions over the last year: @jasonstanbery, @reenybeeny, @iansholtys, @labbydev, @nstriedinger, @lukewertz, @gleroux02, and @plusjeff.

And a special warm thanks to our largest contributor by far, @legostud, for all of the thoughtfulness, care, and ingenuity with which you've crafted this project!

We hope to see you all around in code. :)

### Added

- DP-4968 - The [Location page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-location-general-content) now supports a "Downloads" section which could be helpful for adding a pdf map, for example.
- DP-4581 / 5023 - We've added sort and filter functionality to the [Event Listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-event-listing) page! Now you can enter a town or zip to sort events by proximity and you can filter events by a future date time frame.  (Also, developers will notice that the Event and Location listing js is shared, since the functionality is so similar.) ([PR #589](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/589))
- DP-5341 - We've created a new pattern called [Collapsible Content](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-collapsible-content)!  Eventually this pattern could be used for functionality like [Contact Us as accordion](https://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-contact-us-collapsed-with-more-link) where it will accept child patterns using the `path / data` construct similar to Rich Text, sidebar widgets, etc. ([PR #581](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/581))
- DP-4323 / 4325 - We've finished documenting all the patterns! (PRs [#545](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/545), [#546](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/546)).

### Changed

- DP-5307 - In response to some Mass.gov content author feedback, Users will notice that the [image + map banner (i.e. the Location Banner)](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-location-banner) on the [Location page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-location-general-content) has been made more narrow and fits within the page content width constraints.  This allows for a more convenient image size (of 800x400) to be used. ([PR #576](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/576))
- DP-3222 / 3914 - Several Mayflower patterns now support optional configuration for their included heading element levels.  (Technical note: This work compensates for the fact that many assistive technologies are not quite up to date with the HTML spec which we have been following all along) ([PR #590](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/590))
- DP-4318 - Users will notice that the font size for links in the sidebar are more consistent.  (See example on the ["Social" and "Offered By" on the Service page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-service)). ([PR #588](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/588))
- DP-5653 - Our [Location listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-location-listing) and [Event listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-event-listing) page geosort functionality is now 8 times more cost effective (from 2 api credits down to .25 api credits!) ([PR #602](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/602))
- DP-3763 - Users will notice that the zoom level has been set to a more appropriate level on maps which have only 1 marker (i.e. on the [Location page (general content)](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-location-general-content)). ([PR #604](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/604))
- DP-5234 / 5177 - We've made some backwards-compatible updates to several patterns.  See [PR #571](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/571) for details.
- Github #565 - Devs will notice that we've updated some npm packages. ([PR #565](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/565))

### Removed

- DP-4313 - Users will notice that the logo image has been removed from the [Service page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-service). ([PR #596](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/596))
- DP-4858 - Users will notice that the "DRAFT" status indication has been removed from the front end of the [Decision page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-service). ([PR #597](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/597))

### Migrate Path

- DP-4968 - To use this new "Downloads" section feature on the Location page, populate `mainContent.formDownloads`, include the respective jumplink" in `stickyNav.anchorLinks` wherever you build the Location page data structure, and update your Location page level templating to `include @organisms/by-author/form-downloads.twig`! (See [PR #587 files](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/587/files))
- DP-5307 - Ensure that the images being used for `locationBanner.bgNarrow` are 800x400 as this is now the only image which will render.  (See work tracked in massgov/mass [PR #1188](https://github.com/massgov/mass/pull/1188))
- DP-3222/3914 - To use this new heading level config feature, set the optional heading levels for page patterns where you implement page level templating. (See work tracked in massgov/mass [PR #1157](https://github.com/massgov/mass/pull/1157))
- DP-4313 - To remove the logo from your Service page implementation, simply do not send data in `introSidebar.logo` wherever you do your page level data structuring for this page type. (See [PR #596 files](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/596/files))
- DP-4858 - To remove the visual DRAFT status from your Decision page implementation, simply do not send data in `pageHeader.publishState` wherever you do your page level data structuring for this page type. (See [PR #597 files](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/597/files))
- DP-5234/DP-5177 - We did our best to make these updates backwards compatible, which should mean that you don't need change anything.  You can check [PR #571](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/571/files) for details and also track tests for Mass.gov in [PR# 1386](https://github.com/massgov/mass/pull/1386)
- Github [#565](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/565) - Delete `styleguide/npm_modules` and run `npm install`

## 5.6.1

## Added

## Changed
- For developers - update the deploy script to not require an asset path by default for a prod or fork deploy and to not set the default to mayflower/assets for prod releases.

## Removed

## 5.6.0

### Added
- DP-4181 - Folks browsing through the repository will notice new documentation which explains how to get set up, develop, and make other contributions to Mayflower!  This documentation is linked from the [shiny new repo readme](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower). ([PR #532](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/532))
- DP-4053 - Developers can now follow a documented build + deploy process to ship their code to their own GitHub Pages where their work can be seen and tested! This documentation is linked from the [shiny new repo readme](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower). ([PR #530](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/530))
- DP-4046 - The change above is possible because we can now host Mayflower from a subdirectory (i.e. <myname>.github.io/mayflower)! ([PR #503](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/503))
- DP-4080 - Developers, reviewers, and release managers can (and should!) now follow documentation on Semantic Versioning as it applies to Mayflower.  This means we have guidelines to help reviewers understand what kind of change the code they are reviewing is and to help release managers understand what kind of version of Mayflower they are releasing. This documentation is linked from the [shiny new repo readme](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower). ([PR #504](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/504))
- We documented all the things!  Well, almost all. :)  Check out patterns used on [Service](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-service), [How-To's](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-howto), [Guides](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-guide), [Locations](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-location-park-content), [Topics](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-topic), and [Events](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-event) and prepare ready to be informed! (Remember you can navigate to child patterns by clicking links down in the "Lineage" section.)  More goodness coming soon. (PRs [#521](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/521), [#523](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/523), [#524](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/524), [#527](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/527), [#529](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/529), [#533](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/533))

### Changed
- Outside contribution from @sghoweri - Developers will notice that we now use a fork of Pattern Lab maintained by a Drupal Pattern Lab GitHub organization, with hopes of innovating, and iterating on Pattern Lab and merging changes back upstream to the main Pattern Lab fork.

  This also allows us to see pattern inheritance: browse to a pattern, click the cog icon in the top-right corner, click show pattern info, and see where else patterns are used and which child patterns a given pattern contains. (PRs [#488](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/488) and [#519](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/519))  Thanks Salem!
 - Outside contribution from @evanlovely - Developers will notice an improvement to the automatic  build + browser reload during local development. ([PR #506](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/506)) Thanks Evan!
- Developers will notice standardization on a pattern for writing pattern modification classes, this accounts for nearly all of the backwards-compatible `.twig` changes in this release.
- Developers and implementers will notice that [`@molecules/footnote`](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-footnote) now has an option to render as plain text (as seen in Mass.gov Regulation pages, etc.) ([PR #541](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/541))
- Contribution from our very own @meghandavis - See that typo on the [Press Listing page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-press-listing)?  Nope.  That's because it's fixed!  Thanks Meghan!!

### Removed
- DP-4603 - For developers, the `phing deploy`  task which circle kicks off to deploy to `massgov/mayflower-artifacts` no longer writes to `env.js` (since it's been removed) to set a theme path for js.  ([PR #544](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/544))  Implementers should do this work in their site codebase.  See an example of this at [Mass.gov PR #1065](https://github.com/massgov/mass/pull/1065)

### Migrate path

- See note for DP-4603 above for steps to implement this change.

## 5.5.0

Here comes another Mayflower release, hot off the summertime presses!  We've got 2 new page types and lots of little improvements and fixes coming your way.

 **Mayflower project consumers can take a look at PR's below to confirm, make, and test any markup changes introduced by this release prior to updating in production.*

### New Features
- New page type: [Board Decisions](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-board-decision), which is used for rulings, decisions and opinions issued by agency boards or individuals given the authority to decide specific matters. ([@pages/board-decision](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-board-decision), See [PR #494](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/494))
- We've also added an example [Form Page](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-form-page-example) to highlight form styles (projects likely implement forms using other services) (See [PR #490](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/490) - Markup)
- News ([@organisms/by-author/press-listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-press-listing)) and events ([@organisms/by-author/event-listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-event-listing)) are now surfaced on additional page types (See [PR #498](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/498) - Markup)

### Improvements
- We've added some keyboard functionality to our google map ([@molecules/googlemap](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-google-map)) pattern (See [PR #489](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/489) - JS only)
- We've made the [Regulation page type](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-regulation)  more uniform to other "law" page types (See [PR #494](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/494) - Markup))

### Fixes
- The short description text on a [service detail](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-detail-for-service-howto-location) page banner ([@organisms/by-template/page-banner](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-page-banner)) should render (See [PR #493](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/493))
- Assistive tech like screenreaders will now read callout stats ([@molecules/callout-stats](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-callout-stats)) more naturally (See [PR #500](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/500) - Markup + CSS)
- Semantic search form ([@molecules/header-search]()) label and placeholder text are more understandable (See [PR #485](https://github.com/massgov/mayflower/pull/485) - Markup + demo content)

## 5.4.0
In this new minor release, we've introduced two new Law pages: Policy Advisory and Executive Order, along with several improvements and fixes.

**Projects implementing Mayflower should see the [release tickets](https://jira.state.ma.us/projects/DP/versions/14641) and confirm, make, and test any markup changes introduced by this release prior to updating in production.*

### New Features
- Created a [Policy Advisory](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-policy-advisory-directive) page type (`@pages/policy-advisory-directive`, `@templates/01-content-types/policy-advisory`) used for Directives, Letter Rulings, Administrative Procedures, Opinions, TIRs. (DP-3825)
- Created an [Executive Order](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=pages-executive-order) page type (`@pages/executive-order.twig
`, touched `@molecules/image-promo.twig`, `@molecules/listing-table.twig`) (DP-3829)

### Improvements
- We now have a medium icon (`@atoms/05-icons/svg-medium`) available for patterns like the social media link lists (DP-3495)
- News items can now have an optional featured image (`@templates/01-content-types/press`) (DP-3831)
- Detail page (for service, how-to, location - `@pages/detail-for-service-howto-location`) has been updated: removed key actions, added video (`@atoms/09-media/video`) and map (`@organisms/by-author/mapped-locations`) (DP-3891)

### Fixes
- We've made "Directions" link text (`@molecules/contact-group`) more helpful for screen readers (DP-3227)
- Callout alert links (`@organisms/by-author/callout-alert`)  are now more semantic and accessible (DP-3236)
- The "Go to class Mass.gov" link no longer overlaps with the skip-to link (`@organisms/by-template/header`) for keyboard users (DP-3191)
- Sticky nav links (`@molecules/sticky-nav`) for location and location detail pages are now consistent (DP-3822)
- Inactive (i.e. clickable) sort buttons (`@atoms/01-buttons/button-sort`) now appear clickable, like a link (DP-3890)
-  Homepage > popular searches underline (`@organisms/search-banner.scss`) is now centered (DP-3895)
-  Background images on illustrated links (`@molecules/illustrated-link`) no longer repeats right edge (DP-4026)
- Long text renders in the sidebar correctly (`@atoms/content_link.scss`) (DP-2352)
- Page banner images (`@organisms/page_banner.scss`) will scale as large as possible (be zoomed out) to cover the page banner. (DP-4310)

## 5.3.0
We've added some functionality to the location listings organism ([@organisms/by-author/location-listing](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-location-listing))!  You can sort, filter, and paginate listing results!

Note: The location listing organism is made up of lots of other patterns:
  - [@molecules/location-filters](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-location-filters)
  - [@molecules/results-heading](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-results-heading)
  - [@molecules/google-map](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-google-map)
  - [@molecules/pagination](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=molecules-pagination)
  - [@organisms/by-author/image-promos](http://mayflower.digital.mass.gov/?p=organisms-image-promos)

  And of course, you can still use those patterns in other components!

## 5.2.0

In this short-but-sweet minor release we add a new pilot logo to the header, create a new fixed call to action that floats left/right down at the bottom of the page (see: `@molecules/floating-action.md`), and fix a pesky bug that was centering many headings that should not have been centered.

## 5.1.0

To kick June off, there's a new Mayflower minor release. Announcements Listings and Events are the headliners, but lots of improvements make an appearance at the concert too.

For folks that want to see all the notes:
https://jira.state.ma.us/projects/DP/versions/14638

### NEW FEATURES

- Announcing all the things! Announcement Listing pages cover everything from press releases to speeches. Additionally, content on this page can be filtered by type, agency, topic, and other classifications.

- Directions link now appears after clicking on map pins
- All available activities at a location are now listed on Location pages
- Video description/transcript page has been added

- Consistent spacing between patterns has been added.
- Southbridge location page had its banner coursel replaced with a banner image and Google map.
- Coloring and spacing fixes on the homepage.
- Wording and width adjusted on guides.
- Adjustments to the Location page, with some items removed (quick actions, breadcrumbs, wait times) and added (key actions, contact list).
- Key actions added to Location Park page.
- Details content type is more adaptive to different screen sizes.
- Small label/text changes and other tiny adjustments on Org, G2G, Section Landing, Topic Transition, Helpful Links, Service, Location, and Event Listin pages.

## 5.0.0

Sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an Omlette.  For our next major release (5.0), we're introducing a new Announcement page type and had to change some existing code in progress.

**Note:** This bump from 4.* to 5.* is considered a major release, which means all of our friends who make their sites Mayflowery with this code should read on and integrate locally before updating anything in production.  If you're interested, you can see our integration test steps for Drupal in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbb-l0G39y9o8QMElxGzSi7nBBxDaV9k7hHdxmWAiaU/edit#).

Bonus: if you're on a different page, you can switch over to the G2G theme by typing "cranberry" into the header search and clicking "submit". :) (do this again to get back to the regular theme)

### IMPROVEMENTS
We updated the page patterns (see the Pages dropdown) to match our more generic page type names

### FIXED
As part of this release we fixed a few issues.

1. We fixed a bug where some addresses with special characters weren't showing up on maps.
2. Time callouts and downloads are now aligned with the rest of the page content, even when there is no sidebar content on the page or page section
3. We should no longer see any sidebar widget markup when there is no content for them.

## 4.1.0

### SUMMARY
If you'd like to read about these changes in JIRA:

* [DP-2042](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2042) - [Pattern Lab] Location Listings
* [DP-2078](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2078) - [dev] Update Interstitial Page Code

* [DP-3155](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-3155) - [mf] - Location Filters - Refactor layout to accommodate more tags

### NEW FEATURES

- Ahem... introducing the latest page type to our family: Regulation Details! (Pages > REG 930 CMR 6).  This is a great page type to use to make it easy to read information regarding a specific regulation.
- Wait there's more... We also created a new Service Detail Page (Pages > Service Details).  Services might give you the top level information, but this is where the real information is for a specific service.

### IMPROVEMENTS

1. We've revisited how we named our Sass color variables.  Instead of using $c-theme-blue for example we are now using $c-theme-primary.  This update will make it easy for others to create new color schemes for the Mayflower Patterns.
2. The Location Listing page (Pages > Map listing human services) has been updated from the MVP version to the final version.  The Filters area was expanded to include additonal choices.  The Results area was updated to include tags to show which filters are currently being applied along with pagination.  The Results are also using a newer design that highlights the active or hovered location and makes the corresponding map marker bounce.
3. For the Image Promo pattern, we've changed the description from being a required field to being an optional field.
4. After testing the transition page with low to no vision users, we identified that changing the message from a paragraph to an H1 tag was an added benefit.

### FIXED

As part of this release we fixed a few issues.

1. If a location didn't have any additional contacts the right rail contact us pattern was still showing the "Contacts" heading.  This pattern has been updated to check if it has contacts before rendering any html.
2. The Image Promo pattern was updated to check to check if the read more link has a "text" value before adding that link to prevent an empty link from being added.
3. When an Ordered Step pattern was added to a page with only one step, the number icon was still being shown and the html was being read as a list of one.  This pattern now checks the length of steps to render and only renders it as a numbered list if there are multiple steps.  Otherwise it just outputs a single Action Step item.
4. When a nested ordered list was added to a Rich Text pattern, the nested list items were also being rendered as numbers.  We've updated this to render letters instead.
5. The utility nav was having issue with accessibilty trying to understand the "login to..." link found in the utility nav.  A hidden element has been added to the link to provide more information that screen readers can see.

## 4.0.0

Mayflower turns 4.0.0!  Oh man.  We've been in the lab creating a new page type called How-To (formerly known as Action) and we've got lots of other ~candies~ updates and ~peeps~ goodies packed in to this ~easter basket~ release. :)

**Note:** This bump from 3.* to 4.* is considered a major release, which means all of our friends who make their sites Mayflowery with this code should read on and integrate locally before updating anything in production.  If you're interested, you can see our integration test steps for Drupal in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbb-l0G39y9o8QMElxGzSi7nBBxDaV9k7hHdxmWAiaU/edit#).

### SUMMARY
If you'd like to see the tickets in JIRA:

- [DP-2228 [pattern lab] How-to page updates](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2228)
- [DP-2685 [mf] Add Tabular Fees module to How To Page](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2685)

### NEW FEATURES
- Goodbye Action and hellooooooo How-To page.  Give her a spin at `Pages > HOWTO Unemployment`.
- That same left sticky nav that we all know and love in a How-To (Action) page is now it's own component. ;)  See `Molecules > Sticky Nav`
- We've got a nifty new list of contacts that can optionally be collapsed / expanded in an accordion, like in the main column of a How-To.  See `Organisms > By Author > Contact List`
- Since we were using it on a couple different page types, we created a Details template that contains the meat (or tofu) of the content area for How-Tos and Locations (they're similar in layout - remember right rail?!).  See `Templates > Content Types > Details`
- We now have a mobile-friendly pattern for data tables!  This new component displays as a table on wide screens and as a list on narrow screens.  See `Organisms > By Author > Tabular Data` - and remember you can change display size in pattern lab to see it change layout!

### IMPROVEMENTS
- We've renamed the Action Activities component to Image Promos (See `Organisms > By Author > Image Promos`).  This is a list of image promo molecules (See `Molecules > Image Promo`) that we see on location pages as recommended activities and on map listing pages.
- The Action Sequential List molecule has moved up in the world.  It's now called Steps Ordered and it's an organism!  This is the pattern that lists steps displayed as a numbered list.  See `Organisms > By Author > Steps - Ordered`
- Similarly, the Action Steps organism is now called Steps Unordered and it's got a new look!  This lists steps displayed as accordions that you can collapse and expand. See `Organisms > By Author > Steps Unordered`, `Molecules > Action Step` (with lots of variations!)
- We've made our downloads organism more flexible with an optional heading.  This allowed us to remove the Action Downloads molecule. We updated this new organism name to Form Downloads (replacing Form Download -- See `Organisms > By Author > Form Downloads`).  Finally, this organism includes several singular download link molecules.  See `Molecules > Download Link`.
- Finally, our Page Header organism (See `Organisms > By Template > Page Header`) is shiny like new!  It's still got the title and divider, but now you can also add some optional components to the sidebar (widgets) or under the Title and Sub Title (optional contents).  You can see this flexible pattern in action on the Org Page (`Pages > Org Landing Page`) -- it's all the content in white in between the page banner (title/image) and the action finder (What would you like to do?).

## 3.7.1
In this release of Mayflower, we're just stitching together a little patch with some TLC for the Topic page and also improving our accessibility.

### SUMMARY
Please feel free to check these tickets out in JIRA:

- [DP-2399](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2399) The site name is not announced correctly in Voiceover
- [DP-2401](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2401) The close button is announced as "close plus".
- Github #398 JavaScript Type Errors

### FIXED
- The site logo now introduces itself more accurately, as Mass.gov (instead of Mass gov which was mistaken for Mass Governor), to screen readers and other machines.
- The nifty little "X"  icon found on "close" buttons (think utility nav dropdown or mobile accordions for sub headings and cards) are now safely ignored by screen readers, since we already use text to describe the button.
- We squashed a pesky javascript bug that might have been preventing other javascript from running on the site. (perhaps functionality for a video or map wasn't loading)

## 3.7.0

### SUMMARY
We've updated the topic page!

If you'd like to read about this changes in JIRA:

* [DP-2117](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2117) - [pattern lab] Topic Page Updates

### Improvements
* We've updated the Topic page! (Pages > Topic State Parks and Recreation) - and we're talking more than just a new name (no more L1's here!):
    * The new header layout includes a a spot for a description and a nifty new image size.
    * We've introduced some new variations to the card component (Molecules > Section Links) on the Topic Page:
        * You can now choose between regular links (by default) or callout links (Molecules > Section Links Callout Links).  This will help to call out How-To's and tasks associated with a service on a given topic page.
        * For those times when we don't want to fill the card up with too many links but we want people to know there are more goodies, we've add an optional more link to the bottom of the card.

## 3.6.0

### SUMMARY
If you'd like to read about these changes in JIRA:

* [DP-2471](https://jira.state.ma.us/browse/DP-2471) - Mayflower: guide section with all possible elements

### NEW FEATURES
- Ahem... introducing the latest page type to our family: Services! (Pages > Service Unemployment Benefits).  This is a great page type to use to help surface tons of information related to services, including: branding information, instructional videos, links to how-to's, location information listings, etc.
- We're making Org Landing Pages (Pages > Org Landing Page) more machine and search friendly by adding a Government Organization structured data pattern (Meta > Schema > Government Organization) to the bottom of the page markup.
- For Mayflower implementers, we've created an example Guide page which shows all of the possible elements that can go into a Guide section (Pages > Guide Section Example)

### IMPROVEMENTS
- We've revisited the guide page with some updates.  We've consolidated the formerly 3 guide pages into one shiny new guide page with just those components that our content friends have identified as being pertinent:
  - removed the testimony component
  - alerts links are now optional
  - section key agencies are now optional
  - the related guides show the guide card treatment as opposed to the related pages image thumbnail treatment.
